# Compare Sites Project
This project was created for automation comparing 4 sites:
1. FPDA (https://www.fpda.org/aws/FPDA/pt/sp/home_page)
2. APKCombo (https://apkcombo.com)
3. DropGame (https://dropgame.ru)
4. GooglePlay (https://play.google.com)

## How it works?
I look over all games on DropGame site and compare version on others
If I found bigger version than I have - I send message to the telegram with current and bigger version
